# Installation
Program is run on the command line. User must have NodeJS and the Inquirer and FS packages installed, as well as the subdirectories "lib," "templates," and "output."

# Usage
Run "node app.js" on the command line. Enter employee information as prompted. When your team is added, select "I'm done adding employees", then open the file "output/team.html" in the browser. For less styling, remove the "styles.css" file from the "templates" folder.

# Future Development
I would prefer to have the standard employee questions loop through, with only one role-specific question per role, but I ran out of time to complete that. I'd like to create some sort of "tree", with managers posting to the top row, engineers in the middle, interns on the bottom row, but I couldn't quite get it there. Styling-wise, this was fun. Would like to create more responsiveness in the design, add a place for profile photo, make the card background a solid color (but still have the table be white/gray), and line up the card header so everything is in alignment. Challenges for another day! With regards to styling, it was a good exercise to update the ccorrect files with styling (after everything was working, of course!)
